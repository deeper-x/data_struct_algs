## Requirements
- Go 1.18 or higher

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deeper-x/data_struct_algs.git
cd data_struct_algs
go mod tidy
```

## Usage
Each algorithm and data structure is contained in its own package. Import and use them as needed:

```go
import (
    "github.com/deeper-x/data_struct_algs/sort"
    "github.com/deeper-x/data_struct_algs/search"
)

// Example usage of quicksort
numbers := []int{64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90}
sorted := sort.QuickSort(numbers)

// Example usage of binary search
index := search.Binary(sorted, 22)
```

## Testing
Run all tests:
```bash
go test ./...
```

Run specific package tests:
```bash
go test ./sort/...
go test ./search/...
```
